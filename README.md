# Snake-Game-By-Sujal-Jainani
The snake game starts by placing the snake at the centre and food at a random spot. The snake moves using arrow keys. If it hits a wall or itself, the game ends. When the snake eats food, it grows and new food appears. The loop continues until the player quit or the snake dies.
